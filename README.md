## 📚 About Data

## 🎯 Objective
The Management team at Walmart Inc. wants to analyze the customer purchase behavior (precisely, purchase amount) against the customer’s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. They want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men?
